   Rebel and government forces called a
cease-fire Wednesday and evacuated hundreds of Americans and other
foreigners from hotels in Makati financial area where fighting had
kept them trapped for four days.
   The military chief named a negotiator to discuss a peaceful end
to the crisis with rebels who began a coup attempt against
President Corazon Aquino last Friday.
   Mrs. Aquino had earlier ruled out talks with the rebels and told
them ``surrender or die.'' In an emotional TV address Wednesday,
Mrs. Aquino appealed to the Filipino people for support.
   Speaking extemporaneously, an obviously fatigued Mrs. Aquino
asked Filipinos to turn out in the streets Friday in a show of
support like the February 1986 ``people power'' uprising that
propelled her into office and drove Ferdinand Marcos into exile.
   Wednesday was the sixth day of the insurrection.
   ``You, my beloved countrymen, I depend on you,'' she said. ``Let
us see each other on Dec. 8 and show to the world that the majority
of the Filipinos believe in democracy and will give everything they
can for progress and for peace.''
   The appeal seemed to be a sign that Mrs. Aquino faces mounting
pressure amid the armed challenge by military mutineers and demands
from her own followers for substantial changes in her policies and
administration.
   ``I know that I owe my presidency to you,'' she told the people.
``I did not think of being your president. I just wanted to serve
you. I just want to restore democracy. I want to respect your
rights. I am only asking you to help me. You are my only source of
strength for me to continue our reforms in government. I also
depend on you to see for yourself what these people are doing
against us.''
   Vicky Benito, a receptionist at the Manila Garden Hotel in the
Makati district, said Wednesday morning, ``All Americans are safe.
The Americans are all OK.''
   The U.S. Embassy and Philippine authorities said 164 Americans
were out safely, and that the evacuatio appeared complete. Also
reported out and safe were 70 British, 14 Swiss, 26 West Germans,
17 Singaporeans, 210 Japanese, 40 Australians and 41 Canadians.
   At least 77 people have been killed and more than 540 wounded
since rebel soldiers began their coup attempt.
   A statement by the armed forces said the cease-fire would remain
in effect ``until further orders'' in order ``to allow a smooth
withdrawal of hotel guests from the Makati area.''
   But the statement by military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de
Villa also said the cease-fire was ``in connection with ongoing
negotiations'' to end the fighting.
   De Villa designated Brig. Gen. Arturo Enrile, superintendent of
the Philippine Military Academy, to talk with rebels in the
financial district.
   More than 30 buses shuttled between the battle zone and a
shopping area near the airport, where evacuees were taken until
arrangements can be made for them to leave the country.
   U.S. Consul Bruce Beardsley some of those evacuated would leave
the Philippines on the first available flight.
   A rebel officer said Tuesday that the estimated 215 trapped
Americans might not go free because of U.S. support for Mrs. Aquino
during the uprising, including providing air cover early in the
revolt.
   But a statement issued Wednesday said the insurgents' executive
committee decided late Tuesday to free all the Americans because
``these American tourists are not our enemy.''
   On Wednesday, however, a statement issued in the name of a rebel
leader, Brig. Gen. Edgardo Abenina, declared the insurgents were in
a ``state of war.''
   ``We advise the U.S. government to prepare a plan for the
evacuation of its nationals as the impotent Aquino administration
may not be able to ensure their safety,'' said the statement
distributed to news organizations.
   ``We appeal to the American people to exert pressure on the
United States government to refrain from pursuing any policy or
action which may trigger a new Philippine-American War.''
   About 2,000 foreigners were believed trapped in hotels and
apartments in the area, which the rebels seized Saturday on the
second day of their uprising. ``It was slick,'' said Crosby Nash,
58, of Centerville, Md., of the evacuation. He had been stranded at
the Manila Garden Hotel. ``It was a superb operation. I think
there's certainly relief.''
   Fanny Dickins, a Briton who lives in Hong Kong, said staff at
the Intercontinental woke guests at 7:30 a.m. and told them to
report to the lobby with their smallest piece of luggage.
   She said a rebel officer was in the lobby to see off the
foreigners. Some of them posed for pictures with him.
   ``I found them all sympathetic,'' she said of the insurgents.
``They were very nice and extremely polite, all of them.''
   Safe passage for the foreigners was delayed Tuesday. However,
hundreds of other residents of the district were able to flee amid
the most serious coup attempt so far against Mrs. Aquino.
   Wednesday's evacuation included not only foreigners and
Filipinos in the area's three luxury hotels but also in
condominiums lining Ayala Avenue and other thoroughfares.
   Manila radio stations broadcast instructions to condominium
residents to stay in front of their buildings until the buses
arrived for pickup.
   Private Filipinos offered accommodation to foreigners because
hotels were jammed with Makati residents who fled earlier.
   Rafael Alunan, undersecretary of tourism, negotiated Tuesday
with the rebel leader in Makati. Talks at the Intercontinental
Hotel ended at sunset but apparently resumed early Wednesday. The
rebels offered Monday to let the foreigners leave.
   Earlier, insurgent Capt. Albert Yen said that ``the intention is
not to release Americans. ... U.S. meddling has caused the failure
of the first wave of our assault, so we hold them liable. It is the
responsibility of the U.S. government if we take their nationals
hostage.''
   On Friday, U.S. F-4 Phantom jets flew air cover for loyalist
forces. The planes did not fire on the rebels, but kept them from
continuing air strikes from Villamor Air Base. Rebels seized the
base early in the coup attempt.
   In Washington, the Bush administration had expressed public
concern for the trapped Americans.
   ``You can be assured that the Pentagon has contingency plans for
everything,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, but
would not elaborate.
   Four hundred mutinous Scout Rangers were operating in Makati and
400 other rebels still occupied Mactan Air Base in Cebu, 350 miles
south of Manila.
   Brig. Gen. Jose Commendador, leader of Mactan rebels, said
Tuesday a ``nationwide uprising by the military'' would result if
the government moved against them.
   Vice President Salvador Laurel said in a statement issued
Tuesday in Hong Kong resignation of the government would allow for
``a new mandate'' and avert civil war. Although still vice
president, Laurel broke with Mrs. Aquino in 1987 and formed an
opposition party.
   Continued fighting has strained the economy and weakened public
confidence.

   The Associated Press erroneously reported Dec.
5 that states are affected by a Supreme Court ruling dealing with
city and local government involvement in labor negotiations.
   The court ruled, 6-3, that Los Angeles city officials are
required to compensate a taxi company that went out of business
after the city interfered in a dispute between the company and its
drivers.
   The decision does not affect state governments. The court ruled
last June that states and state officials may not be sued under the
civil rights law at issue in the Los Angeles case.

<HEAD>Thornburgh to Decide Whether Special Prosecutor Needed in HUD Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is conducting a
preliminary inquiry on whether a special prosecutor should
investigate allegations that former Housing Secretary Samuel R.
Pierce violated the law.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh disclosed late Monday that he
had ordered the preliminary inquiry into allegations submitted last
month by 19 Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee.
   The department has 60 days to complete the preliminary inquiry.
Thornburgh's chief spokesman David Runkel said it began Saturday.
   Under the law, the inquiry by the Justice Department's public
integrity section must determine if there are ``reasonable grounds
to believe that further investigation is warranted'' by special
prosecutor, known as an independent counsel.
   Thornburgh's decision was forwarded to the House Judiciary
Committee in a brief letter, which was not released. It was also
filed under seal with a special division of the U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia that appoints independent
counsels and oversees their operation.
   One of the lawmakers, Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., praised the
decision, but suggested Thornburgh launched the preliminary inquiry
only after being prodded by Congress.
   ``There was no necessity of a Judiciary Committee request in
order for the Justice Department to act,'' Morrison said. ``They
could well have done so on their own.
   ``There is no indication that it wouldn't have happened without
our initiative,'' Morrison said.
   The procedure under the special prosecutor law was triggered
Nov. 2 when Morrison and 18 colleagues sent a letter to Thornburgh
requesting appointment of an independent counsel.
   The lawmakers said congressional hearings on the scandal at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development had uncovered evidence
of a conspiracy by Pierce and top aides to award grants based on
political favoritism.
   They also suggested there was evidence Pierce lied under oath
when he told the House Government Operations employment and housing
subcommittee he did not have ``hands on'' involvement in awarding
HUD grants.
   Pierce's lawyers, who had expressed confidence last month that
Thornburgh would find no basis to proceed with a preliminary
inquiry, offered a similar response to the latest news about their
client.
   ``Under the very low threshold the statute requires, we aren't
surprised that a preliminary inquiry has been undertaken,'' said
Robert Plotkin, one of Pierce's lawyers.
   Plotkin said he was confident that Justice Department
prosecutors ``will find there is no basis for appointing an
independent counsel.''
   But Morrison said there was enough evidence generated by
congressional hearings ``that justifies a careful look by an
independent counsel.''
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who with Morrison led the call for
an independent counsel, said Thornburgh's decision ``is a move that
should be welcomed by everyone, including ex-Secretary Pierce.''
   ``This investigation is a fair and thorough way to get answers
to questions that are not going away,'' Schumer said.
   After receiving the lawmaker's request last month, Thornburgh
accused Morrison and Schumer of trying to inject ``partisan
politics into this matter, which has until now been handled on a
non-partisan, professional way by the Congress, HUD and this
department.''
   ``Even more distressing is the assertion by the congressmen that
criminal acts have been committed before criminal investigations
have been completed,'' Thornburgh said.
   The attorney general bristled last week at a reporter's
suggestion that he might have trouble opening an investigation of
Pierce because the two men sat together on President Reagan's
Cabinet.
   ``Let me tell you this, in this or any other case, Dick
Thornburgh is going to go where the evidence leads,'' the attorney
general said. ``If the evidence is there, we will take appropriate
action; if it's not, we won't.''

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev had a direct question at
the superpower summit for President Bush's press secretary, Marlin
Fitzwater, who had derided the Soviet leader earlier this year as a
``drugstore cowboy.''
   ``Marlin, you lose 30 pounds?'' Gorbachev asked the once-stout
Fitzwater.
   There was no mention of the earlier jibe, which had been
intended to question Gorbachev's sincerity about arms-control
proposals.
   Instead, they talked about the liquid diet by which Fitzwater
has lost 35 pounds, dropping to 198 pounds.
   ``That's good,'' Gorbachev said.
   Pleased that the weight loss was noticed, Fitzwater thanked the
Soviet leader.
   Fitzwater gave reporters the account of the conversation with
Gorbachev aboard the Soviet cruise liner Maxim Gorky in Malta's
Marsaxlokk Bay, where Gorbachev and Bush held two days of talks.

<HEAD>Government Says Many ATV Dealers Violate Age Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An undercover government survey shows more
than half of all-terrain vehicle dealers are at least partially
violating an agreement with the Justice Department not to recommend
adult-size ATVs for children younger than 16.
   The study, released Monday by the Consumer Product Safety
Commission, was criticized by a spokesman for American Honda Motor
Co., one of the manufacturers involved in the 1988 consent
agreement limiting ATV sales.
   ``This survey was based on undercover casual conversations with
salesmen and did not involve a sales transaction,'' said Kirk
Antonius, a spokesman for Honda in Los Angeles.
   ``We have a safeguard built into the sales process that requires
the consumer to sign a document saying that he has seen and read
all of the proper safety information and is aware of the age
recommendations by the manufacturers.''
   Antonius also criticized the timing of the release of the
survey, conducted in June.
   ``This is more than a five-month delay in reporting this,'' he
said. ``If they had given us this information five months ago, it
would have helped us in talking to the dealers to be sure that
their sales representatives are doing their best job. If there are
some salesmen providing inappropriate age recommendations, we would
like to know about it and work with our dealers.''
   Ken Giles, a spokesman for the commission, said the survey was
conducted by a contractor and received by the commission about 10
days ago.
   The commission said it based its conclusion on the undercover
survey of 227 randomly selected ATV dealers.
   Recommending use by children under 16 of adult-size ATVs _ those
with engines larger than 80 cubic centimeters _ is contrary to a
consent decree agreed to in 1988 by the commission, the Justice
Department and five U.S. ATV distributors: American Honda Motor Co
Inc., Kawasaki Motors Corp. U.S.A., American Suzuki Motor Corp.,
Yamaha Motor Corp. U.S.A. and Polaris Industries.
   The decree requires ATV distributors to use their ``best
efforts'' to assure that dealers do not sell adult-size ATVs for
use by children under 16.
   ATVs are motorized machines that can traverse rough, off-road
terrain. They range in engine size from 50 to 500 cubic centimeters.
   The commission's study was the second in six weeks to indicate
widespread violation of the consent agreement.
   On Oct. 23, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a private
organization affiliated with consumer advocate Ralph Nader, said 54
percent of dealers it surveyed told volunteers who telephoned them
that an adult-size vehicle would be appropriate for use by children
under 16. That group surveyed 215 dealerships in California,
Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico,
Vermont and Washington.
   The commission said its undercover investigators asked dealers:
``What ATV would you recommend for my 13-year-old boy?''
   It said about 56 per cent of the dealers answered in ways either
partly or completely inconsistent with the age provisions of the
consent decree. Almost 30 percent of them mentioned there are
recommendations against selling big ATV's to children, but
discounted the warning. Another 26 percent did not mention the
age-size guidelines.
   The commission said more than 100 children die each year riding
adult-sized ATV's.
   It said none of the dealers surveyed were selling three-wheeled
ATVs, which are banned by the consent decree.

<TEXT>
   Two Iran-Contra prosecutors deny suggestions
by John Poindexter that they should not handle the case against the
former national security adviser because they were tainted by his
testimony on Capitol Hill under a grant of immunity.
   Poindexter's lawyers say his high-profile testimony compelled by
Congress hopelessly compromised the government's case against their
client.
   However, prosecutors Dan Webb and Howard Pearl said in court
Monday that they were busy with their careers during Poindexter's
nationally televised appearances in July 1987.
   ``I could not tell you if you held a gun to my head one single
fact'' about Poindexter's testimony, said at a pre-trial hearing
called by U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene to consider a
defense motion that the indictment against Poindexter be dismissed.
   Webb, a former U.S. attorney in Chicago, said he was aware
Poindexter was a high-ranking Reagan administration official but
didn't know he was the national security adviser.
   Pearl said he was ``absolutely sure'' he never watched the
Iran-Contra hearings because he was tied up at the U.S. attorney's
office in Chicago handling a criminal investigation of sports
agents.
   Both prosecutors, hired within the past few months to handle the
Poindexter prosecution, acknowledged they must have seen news
accounts of the hearings.
   Greene took the matter under advisement. Oliver North is
scheduled to testify when the pre-trial hearing resumes Dec. 12.
   A 1972 Supreme Court ruling bars prosecutors from making any use
of a defendant's testimony compelled under a grant of immunity.
Poindexter testified under such a grant of immunity about a 1985
arms shipment to Iran.
   Poindexter is charged with one count of conspiracy, two counts
of obstructing Congress and two counts of making false statements
in the Iran-Contra scandal. His trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 22.
   He is accused of trying to cover up North's involvement in the
secret Contra resupply effort and of trying to hide the fact that
Reagan administration officials knew about a 1985 shipment of Hawk
missiles to Iran at the time it happened. The Hawks shipment was
assisted by the CIA without a signed presidential finding as
required by law.
   Webb, who was in private law practice during the congressional
Iran-Contra hearings, said he recalled questions raised in the news
media about ``whether President Reagan had ordered subordinates to
lie or obstruct Congress.''
   Webb said he also remembered questions about ``whether the
president was involved in arms to Iran for hostages'' and
``generally whether the president knew of the diversion of funds
from the Iran effort to the Contra aid effort.''

   The stone plaque calling the
Yasmina quarter the ``neighborhood of the two martyrs'' has not
kept pace with the anger and bitterness built up in two years of
the Palestinian uprising.
   The neighborhood of 6,000 Palestinians, crowded into the old
marketplace known as the Casbah, now has 14 ``martyrs,'' men and
teen-age boys shot by Israeli soldiers along the narrow streets.
   Yasmina has seen all the many sufferings and the few small
triumphs of the ``intefadeh,'' the uprising that began on Dec. 8,
1987, to demand Israel end its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Flag-waving demonstrations, stones, firebombs and the killing of
suspected collaborators have been common in Yasmina, Arabic for the
fragrant Jasmin flower.
   The Israeli response has been tear gas, gunfire, arrests, the
demolition of houses. The latest example came Dec. 2 when soldiers
shot to death four men blamed for killing fellow Palestinians
accused of collaborating with Israel.
   Some Palestinians and Israelis question whether the uprising is
losing its steam after two years of suffering with no real
political gains. But in Yasmina, the talk is of defiance, revenge,
carrying on the battle for a Palestinian state.
   ``We don't want the blood of our sons to go for nothing,''
replied Yusra El Masri, 42, when asked if the revolt will persist.
On the wall opposite hangs a blurry enlargement of a family
snapshot that shows her son, Bashar, dead at age 20.
   ``He was trying to throw two firebombs,'' she said
matter-of-factly.
   Another son and a son-in-law are in jail, accused of taking part
in the uprising, Mrs. El Masri said. She complained angrily of
dozens of visits by Israeli soldiers to question her other five
sons.
   Pulling her youngest son, 3-year-old Fuad, close to her, Mrs.
Masri said: ``I hope he will grow up and avenge the death of his
brother.''
   It's uncertain how much the defiance expressed by Mrs. Masri and
others in Yasmina is mere bravado. One former Nablus policeman,
long familiar with the Casbah, was asked if residents were not worn
down by the long revolt.
   ``They are tired, of course, but I'm not sure they admit it even
to themselves,'' he replied, asking that his name not be used.
   After two years, there is reason for weariness. The Palestinian
economy, never well-developed, has been further hurt by the
three-hour store hours and almost weekly general strikes ordered by
the PLO-backed leaders of the uprising.
   By army estimate, more than 40,000 Palestinians have been
arrested and at least 8,900 injured in the uprising in the West
Bank and Gaza. Palestinians say the numbers are higher.
   In Nablus, with a population of about 100,000, the death toll
from Israel is 66 in the past two years.
   Throughout the West Bank and Gaza, where 1.7 million people
live, 625 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis. At least 154
others have been slain by fellow Arabs as suspected collaborators.
Forty-three Israelis also have been killed.
   Scars of the violence are visible on Sharea Lulu _ Street of the
Pearl _ where the El Masri family lives. Near their home stands the
wreckage of a house partly demolished by the army after a concrete
block was dropped from its roof last February, killing an Israeli
soldier, Binyamin Meisner, 24.
   An Israeli reservist who has served in Nablus said the city
holds both dangers and frustrations for soldiers.
   The 29-year-old corporal, whose name could not be used under
army regulations, said patrolling the Casbah means staying alert to
every motion atop the two- and three-story buildings.
   ``At any moment, you can have rocks or bottles all over you,''
he said, adding that troops also must constantly decide when they
can open fire under regulations allowing use of live ammunition
only if a soldier's life is in danger.
   ``It's a frustration. You're a soldier with a weapon,'' he said.
``It's a very difficult thing. It's spur of the moment.''
   Despite the many deaths in Nablus, the soldier added, ``the
number of casualties is in line with the rules.''
   Abed El Sayeh, whose 13-year-old brother died in army gunfire
last year, has an understandably different view of soldiers' rules.
``Here they shoot at anything that moves,'' he said.
   El Sayeh lives on Sharea Lulu, only steps from the memorial to
the ``two martyrs: his brother, Samir, and a 14-year-old neighbor,
Khaled Tubeleh.
   The families of both can recite a litany of deaths, injuries,
arrests and humiliations at the hands of Israeli soldiers.
   Abed, 21, said he has been jailed four times in the uprising.
Another brother, age 11, broke his arm falling from a roof as
soldiers chased him. The fiance of a 16-year-old sister, Bahia, was
killed Sept. 2 in an army raid.
   Abed expects the stone-throwing and rioting to go on ``until the
Palestinian state is here and the Palestinian flag is flying.'' He
hinted that guns may replace stones if the uprising fails to
produce real results.
   ``We are waiting for peace,'' he said. ``If there's no solution,
there are other means. ... People here would be glad if it turned
to armed struggle.''
   So far, Abed said, the uprising's success has been in forging
Palestinian unity and focusing world attention on Israel's
occupation.
   Israeli officials maintain, however, that Palestinian unity is
often maintained by fear.
   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, Israel's armed forces chief of staff, said
last week the army's task in Nablus was stopping gangs of uprising
enforcers who have been blamed for most of the deaths of 23
supposed collaborators.
   ``I would say our main effort is not directed against the
general public, but against the terror squads that are using force
and pressure on the large groups of population in order to get them
out on the streets,'' he said.
   A day later, a 35-year-old woman was shot to death as an alleged
collaborator in the Casbah. Nearby, a reporter encountered several
members of a gang called the Black Panthers, including one man with
a bulky bag he said held an M-16 assault rifle.
   Another man said the group was ready to expand its activities to
killing Israelis if PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat ended his order to
keep the uprising a ``revolution of stones.''
   ``This is the time for punishing collaborators. When we have
orders from Arafat, we'll finish the others,'' said the man,
wearing a pendant in the colors of the Palestinian flag.
   Eight days after he made that threat, the man and his friend
with the bulky bag were among four Palestinians killed by soldiers
outside a barber shop in the Casbah.

   Until two years ago, the Soviets jammed the
Voice of America and vilified it as an instrument of American
propaganda.
   Until last year, the U.S. government's radio network couldn't
get permission to station a correspondent in Moscow.
   Now, the VOA is playing supersonic tag with Mikhail Gorbachev.
   When Gorbachev flew to Malta for his summit with President Bush,
the ``chase plane'' of journalists from Moscow accredited by the
Kremlin to cover the event also carried VOA Moscow correspondent
Andre de Nesnara.
   De Nesnara, a Russian-speaking American, has been stationed in
Moscow for a year covering the fast-paced changes in the Soviet
Union for the radio network that broadcasts more than 2,000 hours
weekly in 49 languages.
   The crumbling order in Eastern Europe, one of the prime regions
targeted for more than 40 years by VOA broadcasts, has afforded the
network undreamed of opportunities to report on a part of the world
never before accessible to its correspondents. But is has also
forced changes in network thinking.
   ``We came to the conclusion about two years ago that we had to
be more compelling, more interesting'' to compete with the
increasingly free and lively programs by radio stations in Eastern
Europe, said Sidney A. Davis, VOA's programming director.
   VOA has aired roundtable satellite discussions between Soviet
and American experts, as well as call-in programs from the Soviet
Union with listeners asking questions about economic, medical and
scientific issues.
   ``We can offer them expertise their radio stations can't,''
Davis said.
   But the fact remains that VOA gets its money, $180 million
annually, from the U.S. government. Its editorials still reflect
official policy.
   While the editorials on the summit didn't tell VOA listeners
anything that Bush himself didn't tell Gorbachev at Malta, the
language was blunter.
   The United States contends Nicaragua and Cuba are shipping
Soviet-made arms to leftist guerrillas in El Salvador to fight the
U.S.-backed government. Gorbachev said his government isn't
involved and had been assured by the Nicaraguan government that it
has not shipped any weapons to the Salvadoran rebels.
   Bush told reporters at the joint news conference with Gorbachev
that he and the Soviet leader ``have a difference.'' Giving
Gorbachev the benefit of the doubt, Bush said: ``I don't believe
the Sandinistas have told the truth to our Soviet friends.''
   But a Dec. 1 VOA opinion piece was more direct.
   ``High levels of Soviet aid to Cuba and Nicaragua help these
countries to support subversion and destabilization in Central
America,'' it said. ``The Soviet Union should press Cuba and
Nicaragua to curb such activities.
   ``The Soviet Union also continues to pour massive amounts of
heavy weapons into Afghanistan. These weapons are taking a terrible
toll on civilians and help to keep in power a repressive communist
regime.''
   Transcripts of the broadcast reports, as well as of the
editorials, were made available under a recently publicized policy
of openness by VOA.
   The station's 1942 charter forbids it to disseminate its
broadcasts within the United States to prevent the VOA from being
used by the administration to indoctrinate Americans.
   The law does allow American reporters and academics to review
VOA material, but network officials say this access was not widely
known until a recent case involving a lawsuit by NBC News President
Michael Gartner.
   Gartner contends VOA only began allowing access to its broadcast
material after he filed suit against the network's parent agency,
the U.S. Information Agency, which argued that barring
dissemination of USIA material within the United States violates
the First Amendment.
   A U.S. District Court in Iowa last month dismissed Gartner's
suit.

   Vice President Dan Quayle says the Soviet
Union's foreign policy is largely unchanged and he believes the
Soviets' pursuit of their interests creates instability in other
countries, according to a report Tuesday.
   In remarks reflecting more apparent skepticism than President
Bush has shown about Soviet intentions, Quayle said the Soviets
have ``very significant interests beyond their borders and those
interests create instability.''
   ``I don't think they've changed much in foreign policy,'' Quayle
said in an interview with The Washington Post in Tuesday editions.
   ``We cannot count on the Soviets, out of the goodness of their
hearts, in alleviating those tensions for us.''
   But Quayle said he viewed events in one area beyond the borders
of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, as reflecting Soviet domestic
policy.
   ``I get into debates on this with people (in the administration)
who ask about Eastern Europe,'' Quayle was quoted as saying.
   Though Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has been very helpful
in spurring Communist governments in Eastern Europe to reform, ``I
don't view that as a matter of foreign policy as much as domestic
policy.''
   ``My viewpoint is the new thinking and the real reform is in the
area of economics,'' Quayle said.
   Quayle said he ``hadn't seen any evidence of their slackening
off'' aid to Cuba and Nicaragua.
   On the summit meeting of President Bush and Gorbachev, Quayle
said he thought a strategic arms agreement ``is something that
could be achieved'' on the timetable agreed to by the two leaders.
   Bush told a news conference in Brussels on Monday the West
stands ``at the threshold of a new era'' but he declined to endorse
Gorbachev's suggestion that the Cold War is over. ``That day hasn't
arrived,'' Bush said.

<HEAD>Ozone Hole Closed for Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Antarctic ozone hole is closed for this
year after the window allowing dangerous ultraviolet radiation to
reach the Earth was open at near record levels.
   The hole, actually a region of depleted ozone levels in the
stratosphere over the South Pole, approached record levels in
October, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said
Monday.
   Ozone levels in that region have returned to normal, said Walter
Komhyr of NOAA's Air Resources Laboratory.
   Ozone in the upper atmosphere helps screen the Earth from
dangerous ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Scientists are
concerned the hole over Antarctica could endanger marine life in
that region and, if the depletion spreads, cause increased skin
cancer and other health problems.
   Scientists measure ozone in Dobson units, with a measurement of
270 to 300 considered normal for the area over the Antarctic.
   When the ozone hole forms, levels drop drastically, setting a
record at 125 Dobson units in 1987 and falling to 135 units this
year.
   Levels rebounded to 322 units by mid-November, then declined
somewhat and are now estimated at near 300, Komhyr said in a
telephone interview.
   During the Antarctic spring, a band of winds encircles the
continent, preventing the air there from mixing with the atmosphere
in other parts of the world.
   During that period, temperatures drop to minus 125 degrees
Fahrenheit and colder in the upper atmosphere, creating a situation
in which manmade chlorofluorocarbon chemicals can mix with and
destroy the ozone. Those reactions cease later in the year, when
temperatures warm to minus 70 degrees or so, and the winds break
down, allowing polar air to mix once again with air from other
areas and thus restore ozone to more normal levels.
   The breakup of the polar vortex winds has been occurring quite
late in the last few years, Komhyr said, compared with the 1960s
and 1970s, when it took place several weeks earlier. The cause of
the delay is not well understood, he said.
   The period of greatest ozone depletion this year extended from
Oct. 6 to Oct. 9, Komhyr said. The depletion was nearly as deep as
in 1987, but didn't last quite as long as that year, he said.

<TEXT>
   The leftist political
opposition and humanitarian groups labeled as subversive for
working with the poor have been driven underground or out of the
country by a climate of persecution.
   Eileen Rosin, the sole representative of the Los Angeles-based
Medical Aid for El Salvador, left the country Monday after
discovering her office was ransacked over the weekend.
   Neighbors said about 20 men in military uniforms entered it
before dawn Saturday.
   For eight years, Medical Aid has distributed money for
prosthetic devices, delivered donated medicines to hospitals and
sent dozens of children to the United States for operations beyond
the technical means of Salvadoran hospitals.
   Ms. Rosin, 35, had worked in El Salvador for two years and left
reluctantly for Los Angeles.
   ``We had two little girls lined up for heart operations in the
States. I don't know what will happen to them now,'' she said.
   The United Nations on Friday said it will transfer its
Salvadoran offices to Guatemala ``for lack of guarantees.''
   Officials found equipment and furniture at the main U.N. offices
smashed following fighting last week around the building, in the
affluent neighborhood of Escalon.
   Army troops had occupied the offices, which administered UNICEF
and refugee projects, after U.N. personnel were evacuated. When
U.N. officials returned, they found scrawled on the walls: ``U.N.
equals FMLN equals Traitors.''
   The letters stand for Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front,
the rebel group that last month launched its biggest offensive of
the 10-year-old civil war.
   The U.S.-backed government of rightist Alfredo Cristiani
responded by declaring a state of siege that suspended
constitutional guarantees.
   Hundreds of people have been detained since, including two dozen
foreigners who work with churches or humanitarian groups. Almost
all the non-Salvadorans have been deported, although some remain
jailed facing charges.
   Foreigners who work with the poor are called
``internationalists,'' and they are a favorite target of the right,
which accuses them of supporting revolution.
   A flier signed ``Salvadoran air force,'' considered the most
rightist branch of the armed forces, was found strewn on city
streets over the weekend.
   ``With God, reason and might, we shall conquer,'' it said.
``Salvadoran patriot: You have every right to defend your life and
your property. If in order to do this you have to kill FMLN
terrorists and their internationalist allies, do it.''
   ``We are in the catacombs. There is no prospect for above-ground
humanitarian work with the poor in the short or middle term,'' said
Episcopalian Rev. Luis Serrano, whose church has for years done
social, medical and educational work with displaced people and
refugees.
   He commented in an interview in Mariona prison, where he and
eight members of his church are jailed as alleged subversives.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has said the crackdown by
the government and armed forces was ``absolutely appropriate.''
   Washington has provided $4 billion in aid this decade to the
Salvadoran government in the war, which has killed 71,000 people,
1,000 of them in the latest fighting.
   U.S. Ambassador William Walker likened the raids and arrests to
the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.
   ``I'm not condoning it. But in times like these of great emotion
and great anger, things like this happen. Even in the U.S., with
all its guarantees, it happened,'' Walker said.
   ``There are a series of indications of a climate of
persecution,'' said Monsignor Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary
bishop of San Salvador, after Mass on Sunday. ``Not only against
personnel of the Catholic church, but against many people who try
to help the most humble and the most poor.''
   ``It appears that the military authorities, in their quest to
restore order, have adopted as their criteria the saying, `Think
the worst, and you'll be right,''' he said.
   The climate of war and fear has tinged even jokes. One goes like
this:
   Two soldiers are patrolling the streets 10 minutes before the
beginning of the nightly curfew. They pass a man walking quickly in
the opposite direction. One soldier turns around and fatally shoots
the man.
   ``Why'd you do that?'' asks his companion.
   ``I know that guy. He lives 20 minutes from here.''

   National drug director William J. Bennett and
budget director Richard Darman are ``apart by more than a couple of
hundred million dollars'' on spending to fight drugs in 1991 and
President Bush may settle the dispute, an administration official
says.
   ``It's a big enough gap that it's likely to have to go to the
president,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The recently approved anti-drug budget for the 1990 fiscal year
totaled $8.8 billion, which Congress had boosted by $900 million
over Bush's request of $7.9 billion.
   ``I'd expect to see a real increase'' in 1991, not just an
adjustment for inflation, the official said in an interview Monday.
   But how much has not been determined, said the source, who
refused to provide details on how much is being sought by Bennett,
director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, and how
much is sought by Darman, director of the Office of Management and
Budget.
   ``Bennett and Darman are apart by more than couple of hundred
million dollars,'' the official said. ``It may end up going to the
president to get things sorted out. Hard to know when.''
   Bennett spokesman Don Hamilton said, ``This is the time of year
when lots of agency heads and Cabinet secretaries are talking to
Darman, occasionally in strong terms.''
   Meanwhile, Bennett's office is continuing work on what is being
referred to among officials as ``Strategy Two,'' the update on the
national drug control strategy Bush presented Sept. 5. The update,
like the original strategy, was required by Congress.
   Hamilton said the updated strategy will add detail to some
areas, focus on several anti-drug plans being employed around the
country that are working and will get into specifics on proposed
budgets.
   Expected to be included are the designations of cities or areas
considered ``high-intensity drug trafficking areas'' that would be
eligible for additional federal resources, both in money and
personnel.
   Published reports have said the areas to be designated in the
upcoming strategy are Los Angeles, New York, Miami, Houston and the
southwest border, but officials in Bennett's office say no final
decisions have been made.
   ``The conversations in reference to high-intensity drug
trafficking areas are still ongoing,'' said Reggie Walton, the drug
office's associate director for state and local affairs.
   ``I have thoughts in my mind what areas stand at the top of the
list,'' said Walton, who took the lead on determining the criteria
for designating the targeted areas.
   In the current fiscal year, only $25 million total has been
allocated from the federal budget for such areas, but that could
increase by $20 million to $21 million with money coming out of the
federal asset forfeiture fund, Walton said. That fund contains
revenue from assets seized from drug traffickers.
   The second administration official said even the higher amount
``is not that much money to begin with. Los Angeles spent $2
billion in the drug war in L.A. County. We're looking at dividing
this money up among four, five, six, seven areas. What can you do
with this money? Obviously, we'll be looking at more money later.''
   Walton would not say how much money he would seek in the 1991
budget for the high-intensity drug trafficking areas.
   The federal effort to crack down on drugs in the nation's
capital alone will cost about $97 million, Bennett has said.
However, that includes money for three drug treatment centers and a
new jail for the District of Columbia still in the planning stages.
   Walton said some places designated as high-intensity drug
trafficking areas could get computers to enhance targeting of
money-laundering operations, while others may need more prosecutors
or law enforcement agents.

<HEAD>Ted Turner's Neighbors Want Electricity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPPS, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five families who live without electricity
near Ted Turner's 8,100-acre plantation say they want the
broadcasting executive to allow power lines to cross his property
to their homes.
   Dressie Sloan, with the Jefferson County National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, accused Turner of trying to
get rid of his poor neighbors by refusing to extend the electric
lines.
   ``One word from Mr. Turner, and they'd have their lights,''
Sloan told the Tallahassee Democrat Sunday. ``He has the power and
the money to do it, but he wants to squeeze them out.''
   But Avalon Plantation manager George Purvis said Turner was only
complying with a former owner's restrictions.
   ``Mr. Turner has never tried to get those people to move out,''
Purvis told the newspaper. ``But Mrs. (Alexandra) McKay thought an
above-ground wire would destroy the national beauty of her land.''
   Dee Woods, Turner's personal assistant in Atlanta, said he was
unavailable to answer Sloan's complaint.
   About a mile through the woods from the plantation, Frances
Oliver has lived in one of the three tarpaper-covered shacks for 30
years.
   ``We used to have a school out here, a church and maybe a couple
hundred people,'' she said. About a dozen people now live on almost
215 acres surrounded by tree farms, hunting clubs and plantation
forest.
   Ms. Oliver said she relies on a wood stove for cooking and
heating. She totes water from a plantation well and reads by a
kerosene lamp. Car batteries run her TV set.
   Electricity would be nice, Ms. Oliver said. ``Maybe it would
bring the people back,'' she said.
   But even if Turner did approve the extension, Purvis said he
wondered who would foot the bill. A power line from the
plantation's terminal to the houses would cost at least $40,000,
according to Ronald Bass, a manager for Tri-County Electric
Cooperative.
   State law gives people the right to draw power from a utility
company, but since Tri-County is a rural co-op it operates under
federal guidelines, and does not have to install the lines free of
charge.

   A woman stole a patrol car from a

boyfriend with a stalled car, authorities said.
   Beverly J. Watt, 29, got into the car and headed north on
Interstate 25, leaving behind a confused boyfriend and a bewildered

   Watt was arrested a short time after the incident Sunday
following a chase in Cheyenne, Wyo., that ended in a collision

   Watt was admitted to a Cheyenne hospital for psychiatric
observation, Klith said, adding that charges are pending.
   Deputy Bill Eckrich had stopped to talk with the stranded

   ``The next thing we knew, she was talking on his radio,'' Klith
said. ``She was very belligerent and using foul language. She

   ``I love playing Eddie. But, I didn't want to reprise the role

   Rather than inspiring creativity, drugs more
often hamper musicians, blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan and
other artists say in the December issue of Musician magazine.
   ``The obsession with the quick fix becomes not just a crutch,
but everything to us,'' said Vaughan, who recently kicked a
long-term drug habit. ``And then what really matters gets pushed
out the window.''
   The Red Hot Chili Peppers' latest album, ``Mother's Milk,''
includes an anti-drug anthem inspired by the recent death of the
band's guitarist, Hillel Slovak, from a heroin overdose. ``Losing
your best friend at the age of 26 is a mind- and soul-blower,''
said Anthony Kiedis, the funk band's lead singer.
   Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead recently gave up an eight-year
heroin habit, but says, ``It's tough for me to adopt a totally
anti-drug stance. ... (Heroin is) the perfect comfort drug. I
understand perfectly why people use it. It would be a nice old-age
drug. But it's definitely wrapped up in itself; it doesn't let you
go anywhere.''

   Officials of an anti-drug program are
defending it against complaints by Alice Sessions, wife of FBI
Director William Sessions, who resigned as head of the organization.
   Ms. Sessions said the ``Join the Move'' project used the FBI
chief's name to court donations and ``I just couldn't be associated
with that.''
   One of those who got a sales call was the Sessions' son, who
lives in Texas, she told the Austin American-Statesman.
   Ms. Sessions also expressed concern over the group's
fund-raising tactics, which involved selling spices, jellies and
sauces.
   Officials of the program, sponsored by the Austin-based Texas

   Reforms in Eastern Europe allowed a
change in location for the shooting of a movie on the life of
Polish leader Lech Walesa, a report says.
   The film will be shot in Poland instead of West Germany as
originally planned, according to the Hollywood Reporter.
   The authorized biography of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning
Solidarity leader will be produced by James W. Brubaker and Thom
Mount beginning in 1990, Warners and the Mount Co. said in a joint
release Monday announcing the $20 million film.
   Mount acquired the rights to Walesa's story nine months ago from
a group that included director Stanley Kramer.

<HEAD>Congressional Budget Writers Wary of `Peace Dividend'</HEAD>

   Top Democratic congressional budget writers
agree with President Bush's warning that a proposed trimming of the
Pentagon's budget won't produce a ``peace dividend'' for domestic
programs.
   Liberals and other lawmakers hope the easing of Cold War
tensions will translate into a siphoning of defense money into
health, education, transportation and other domestic needs.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is studying plans to pare up to
$180 billion from anticipated military spending increases through
1994. The administration says it's still trying to decide what the
size and shape of the cuts will be.
   But the chairmen of Congress' two budget committees expressed
caution Monday for those who hope the reductions will mean a
windfall for other government initiatives.
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., said his
analysis of defense reductions under study by the administration is
that savings of just $2 billion are likely next year.
   Over five years, military spending would still increase by $200
billion, excluding the effects of inflation, he said.
   ``Clearly, there is no so-called peace dividend,'' said Sasser,
whose figures were based on Pentagon plans and economic projections
announced earlier this year.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee, said there are still too many unknowns to predict
whether domestic programs will benefit from defense cuts Bush is
expected to propose.
   Panetta said there are questions about the types of savings he
will seek, whether aid will be sought to offset economic
dislocations caused by closed bases and weapons plants, and how
much of the cutbacks would go to deficit reduction.
   ``I have always been very cautious about arguing for a defense
dividend,'' he said.
   Liberal lawmakers argue that with better U.S.-Soviet relations,
it's time to shrink the defense budget, which comprises about
one-fourth of the government's $1.2 trillion annual spending.
   ``The more you cut from the military, the less damage you do to
domestic programs to meet Gramm-Rudman targets,'' Rep. Barney
Frank, D-Mass., said Monday.
   Frank has been a leader of a group of liberals pressing
congressional leaders to slash about $20 billion from the Pentagon
budget and redistribute most of it among health, housing, education
and other domestic programs.
   Bush, speaking Monday to reporters at a Brussels, Belgium, news
conference after his summit with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, tried to douse those hopes.
   ``We have a lot of demands at home, and there's no question
about that,'' Bush said. ``But I think it is premature to speak as
some are at home about a peace dividend _ take a lot of money out
of defense and put it into other worthy causes.''
   The president cited the problems the government will have in
scraping together enough savings to meet the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law's requirement of a fiscal 1991 shortfall of
no more than $64 billion.
   The administration is expected to forecast a deficit for fiscal
1990, which ends Sept. 30, of about $110 billion. Bush will submit
his proposed 1991 budget to Congress on Jan. 22.
   ``There just isn't a lot of, quote, excess money, unquote,
floating around there,'' Bush said.
   The cuts Cheney is considering would be made from increases
already projected. Thus, rather than reducing military spending
totals, they are widely expected on Capitol Hill to leave Defense
Department outlays near the current level of about $290 billion.
   Since 1986, military spending has decreased by an average of 3
percent annually when inflation is taken into account, even though
the actual amount going to the Pentagon has increased each year.
Defense Department outlays, $265 billion in 1986, should reach $287
billion this year.
   Defense spending is difficult to shrink quickly because much of
it _ such as purchases of fleets of jet fighters _ is committed in
contracts that span several years. Even reducing numbers of troops
has offsetting costs, such as higher civilian unemployment rates.
   The conventional wisdom among lawmakers and lobbyists is that
the 1991 Defense Department budget is unlikely to contain
reductions of more than $3 billion to $8 billion from the increases
that were already planned for the year.

<HEAD>Molten Rock Triggers Quakes Under Volcano, But Eruption Unlikely</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Molten rock moving beneath California's
Mammoth Mountain ski resort triggered thousands of small
earthquakes since May, but the U.S. Geological Survey says the old
volcano is unlikely to erupt.
   ``We still see occasional bursts of quake activity, but it's
much more sporadic'' in recent weeks than in June, when hundreds of
tiny jolts each day rattled the 11,053-foot mountain in the Sierra
Nevada, said USGS geophysicist Dave Hill, the scientist in charge
of monitoring the situation.
   In a statement issued Monday, the federal agency said: ``While
eruptive activity as a consequence of this current earthquake swarm
cannot be ruled out, observations at many volcanoes in the world
suggest the most likely outcome ... is a return to an extended
period of relative quiescence.''
   Hill discussed the ``swarm'' of quakes under Mammoth Mountain
during a Monday session at the American Geophysical Union's fall
meeting.
   Only four of the thousands of quakes that started May 4 measured
more than 3 on the Richter scale, so most were too small to be
felt. Some of the quakes were only 1.5 miles deep and often came in
rapid-fire bursts.
   Mammoth Mountain has bulged upward about one-half inch since
May, Hill said.
   The most likely explanation for the quakes and bulging is that
molten rock, or magma, is being squeezed into a vertical crack that
extends from 3.5 miles to 6 miles below Mammoth Mountain's south
flank, he said.
   This sheetlike intrusion is called a dike, and excavations at
many old volcanoes reveal that most dikes never erupt to the
surface, Hill explained.
   Mammoth Mountain, now covered with ski runs, last erupted
explosively about 50,000 years ago and is located just outside the
southwest rim of Long Valley caldera. The caldera is a
20-by-10-mile oval-shaped crater created 730,000 years ago by one
of the world's greatest eruptions.
   That blast spewed at least 600 times more material than the May
18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens.
   The resort town of Mammoth Lakes sits inside the caldera a few
miles east of Mammoth Mountain. Hill cautioned against undue
volcano phobia, saying it is ``more dangerous to drive up on U.S.
395 than to spend time skiing or living near Mammoth Lakes.''

   Presidential Airways Inc., which filed for

is discontinuing all its flights.
   ``Our Chapter 11 filing has resulted in a reduction in our
passenger loads,'' president and chief executive officer Harold J.

   ``At this point it is prudent for the company to conserve as
much of its cash as possible. We will review our options for the

   The service was discontinued effective Monday.
   Presidential began four years ago as a mid-size carrier,
switched to a charter service and then to a feeder service for
Continental Airlines, which then maintained a hub at Washington
Dulles International Airport at Herndon.
   However, Houston-based Continental closed its Washington hub,
and in January 1988 Presidential became a feeder for United. It
recently had been operating 24 flights a day to and from six cities.
   According to court documents, Presidential had $30 million in
assets and $76 million in liabilities as of June 30. Its largest
creditor, British Aerospace PLC, is owed about $26 million for
aircraft, the documents said.

<TEXT>
   At Army &amp; Lou's, one of the nation's most elegant
purveyors of black American cuisine, the owner is working to lower
cholesterol _ showing that soul food doesn't have to be hard on the
heart.
   ``A lot of people cannot imagine soul food without using lard,
heavy fat and grease, but people are very health-conscious today,''
said owner Avis Piper, who supervises the kitchen and occasionally
helps cook.
   ``We're making a statement that soul food doesn't have to have
fat, or oil or cholesterol to be soul food and to be healthy food.''
   On a recent Saturday night, patrons at the 200-seat restaurant
included many of Chicago's leading black officials: a U.S.
congressman, the county prosecutor and four state lawmakers.
   The South Side business also is frequented by black and white
celebrities such as Bill Cosby and the cast of his TV family, the
Rev. Jesse Jackson and U.S. Sen. Paul Simon.
   The menu, with more than 100 items, runs the gamut from
black-eyed peas and ham hocks at $7 to filet mignon and lobster
tails at $35.
   The meats mostly are lean. Vegetables are steamed rather than
fried or boiled. Entries like the sweet-potato pie and salmon
croquettes are cholesterol-free.
   No salt, artificial flavorings or additives are used, and
vegetable shortening is substituted for lard in cooking.
   Mrs. Piper says the low-cholesterol dishes offer some customers
more of a choice. Dempsey Travis, a prominent black real estate
developer and writer, is one who's hooked.
   ``There are certain things like catfish I wouldn't eat, but now
I find it highly desirable and delicate,'' said Travis, who eats at
the restaurant at least twice a week. ``It's just the kind of place
you're proud to take a person,'' he said.
   The restaurant was founded in 1945 by William Armstrong, whose
nickname was Army, and his wife Luvilla, known as Lou. The two ran
it for 28 years before selling to another couple.
   Mrs. Piper, a former public school teacher and interior
designer, and her husband, Benjamin, an accountant, were regular
patrons before buying the restaurant 15 months ago.
   Mrs. Piper, who had been an amateur gourmet cook, says she hopes
the restaurant will help set a trend toward healthier soul food.
   Dr. Linda Van Horn, a registered dietician at the Northwestern
University Medical School, says that's a welcome change.
   ``It's well-known that the black population has a higher risk
for heart disease, stroke, hypertension and diabetes than the white
population because of diet and other factors,'' she said.
   ``Hopefully, the risks can be reduced without altering the
flavor that people love,'' she said.

   Seven jurors had been seated Monday in the second-degree

when Mellen T. Benedict made his statement to prosecutor Andy
Dempster, according to court officials.
   Asked by Dempster if he could judge the case on evidence from
the witness stand, Benedict responded that it was his professional

   Benedict is listed in the telephone book as a ``metaphysical
expert and professional psychic.''
   Ray Vallery, representing Alford, said the defense couldn't
proceed if any of the jurors believed what Benedict said.
   ``I didn't hear anyone laughing in the courtroom when he said
it,'' Vallery said.
   Alford and McNeil are accused of a 1988 burglary. The trial was

   A space shuttle returning to Earth set off
sonic booms that shook the ground under Los Angeles, showing city
skyscrapers may be more vulnerable to earthquakes than previously
believed, researchers say.
   ``It means that during an earthquake, the buildings may sway
more than had been expected because of the sediments in the Los
Angeles Basin,'' said U.S. Geological seismologist Jim Mori, a
co-author of the study by scientists from the USGS and the
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
   The shuttle-induced ground motion, which never had been noticed
until Columbia descended Aug. 13, was discussed Monday at the
American Geophysical Union's fall meeting by Caltech geophysics
professor Hiroo Kanamori, chief author of the study.
   ``Engineers say we don't need to worry about it, but I'm not so
sure,'' Kanamori said. ``It's time to really think about this
problem more carefully and more seriously.''
   ``While these results certainly call for close study, I don't
believe there's any cause for alarm,'' said Caltech civil engineer
James L. Beck.
   Kanamori, Mori and their colleagues found that the shuttle's
characteristic twin sonic booms thumped 400 high-rise buildings in
downtown Los Angeles and the nearby Wilshire district when Columbia
swept northeast over the city at 2,600 mph before landing at
Edwards Air Force Base. The base is about 80 miles north of Los
Angeles.
   The early morning booms prompted dozens of alarmed calls to
police. The shuttle was returning from a five-day mission to deploy
a spy satellite.
   The thumps against the buildings were transmitted down to the
soft sediment of the Los Angeles Basin, triggering seismic waves
that reached Caltech instruments 12.5 seconds before the sonic
booms were heard there. That's because waves move more quickly
through rock than through air.
   The scientists learned from the data that the soft,
1.25-mile-deep sediment beneath Los Angeles amplifies the effects
of slow, swaying ``long-period'' quake waves with a period _ or
time between wave crests _ of 2 to 3 seconds. Short-period waves
cause sharp jolts.
   Buildings 20 to 30 stories tall tend to sway back and forth once
every 2 to 3 seconds, making it possible that ``in an earthquake,
the Los Angeles basin would preferentially amplify ground motion
... giving 20- to 30-story buildings more shaking than if they were
founded on (solid) rock,'' Caltech said in a news release.
   Kanamori and Mori estimated buildings on the sediment would
shake three to five times worse than those on solid rock. That's
less severe than the tenfold and greater amplification of shaking
during the great quakes of 1985 in Mexico City, which rests on an
old lake bed.
   Henry Koza, a structural engineer at EQE Engineering in Los
Angeles, said skyscrapers ``are designed and built to pretty strict
criteria. ... There's so much inherent flexibility in high rises
they can accommodate significant motion.''
   ``I don't think those buildings are going to fall down,'' said
Egill Hauksson, a University of Southern California seismologist.
``Probably the engineers are right in that they have designed these
buildings with some overestimates of what the shaking might be to
make sure the buildings are safe.''
   But Kanamori said: ``My feeling is these effects have not been
really evaluated very carefully and very quantitatively.''
   Robert Harder, assistant chief of the city's Building Bureau,
said the city requires buildings taller than 160 feet to be
designed using computer-simulated quakes to test loads, stresses
and swaying.
   ``We feel our requirements in the city are adequate. They go way
beyond what other agencies have required,'' Harder said.
   Scientists for years have said a magnitude-6.5 quake in or near
Los Angeles would be as bad or worse than the much-feared,
magnitude-8 ``big one'' on the more distant San Andreas Fault.
   Kanamori and Mori conducted the study with Caltech geophysicist
Don Anderson, and USGS seismologists Tom Heaton and Lucile Jones.

some type of detonator between bags of gunpowder in one of the

   The fog-shrouded streets were
empty, unpounded this day by the hundreds of thousands who had
successfully pressed the ruling Communists to abandon one-party
rule.
   Only tourists, pub crawlers and window shoppers, bundled against
the damp cold, strolled past the Christmas displays on downtown
streets Sunday, when authorities announced a coalition Cabinet
still dominated by Communists.
   Most Czechs and Slovaks were at home, and when the announcement
came many were watching on television a tennis match or a concert
in Prague's Sports Stadium that benefited the opposition coalition
Civic Forum.
   Before 20,000 people at the stadium, a rock band turned up its
amplifiers to blast out its angry response to the government: a
spirited rendition of the Rolling Stones song, ``(I Can't Get No)
Satisfaction.''
   The crowd roared in approval, a harbinger of the massive
anti-government demonstrations that resumed Monday.
   Few people on the streets Sunday or in the smoky cafes and bars
were impressed by the government move, and others strolled on
unaware.
   Life around the Hradcany Castle went on as usual, with parents
out for the afternoon, their kids stopping to gawk at the
ceremonial guard outside the presidential residence. Only the odd
leaflet glued to a doorway, or a dab of colorful graffito, recalled
two weeks of unprecedented public protest.
   In the magnificent Old Town square, a large group of American
tourists _ guidebooks in hand _ seemed more interested in the
Middle Ages than the peaceful revolution at hand. One woman, on
learning that an American passer-by was a journalist, asked: ``Oh,
why are you here?''
   At Slavia, an elegant old cafe across from the National Theater,
a blend of Prague's golden youth and its punk culture ate up all
the ice cream by 10 p.m. Their talk of politics was leavened by
peals of laughter.
   After the government announcement, scores of pro-democracy
activists gathered at the Civic Forum headquarters to plan strategy.
   Outside the Laterna Magika theater, hundreds stood shivering to
watch videotaped opposition statements from televisions set up in
upper floor windows.
   In the early evening, opposition leaders denounced the
Communist-dominated Cabinet on national television and called for a
general strike if a new government more to their liking is not
seated.
   On another channel, West Germany's Boris Becker and Sweden's
Stefan Edberg were locked in a bitter second set in the finals of
the Masters tennis tournament from New York.

of America, employed by Nynex subsidiary New York Telephone, and
20,000 members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers, at New England Telephone, affected 10 million customers.
   It began Aug. 6 and was the last of four regional phone company
strikes to be resolved. The IBEW and New England Telephone did not
settle until Nov. 20. The CWA ratified its contract Friday.
   New York Telephone said it was trying to fill more than 100,000
service orders and a potential backlog of another 150,000
installations with customers who withheld orders during the work
stoppage.
   Filling those orders will take until May, the company said.
Repair work, it said, is up to date.
   During the strike, some 10,000 managers filled in for striking
workers. One striker was killed in a strike-related car accident,
and Nynex claimed hundreds of acts of sabotage were made against
its property.
   A major sticking point was a proposal by the company that
workers share the cost of health care. Nynex conceded this point in
exchange for reduced wage increases.

   The USS Iowa sails into port this week with
the controversy over an explosion that killed 47 sailors no more
settled than when the battleship set sail six months ago.
   The Iowa was in the Mediterranean when the Navy released a
report saying a disgruntled gunner's mate, who died in the April 19
blast, sabotaged one of the warship's massive 16-inch guns.
   But the Navy report has been widely criticized by relatives of
the victims and military watchdog groups, and intensely scrutinized
by Congress.
   The House Armed Services subcommittee is holding hearings on the
report next week, and the Senate Armed Services Committee next week
will get testimony from Capt. Fred P. Moosally, the Iowa's
commander. The General Accounting Office is reviewing the Navy's
findings.
   The Iowa is due in port later this week, probably Thursday,
according to officials.
   The Navy said the explosion was most probably caused by an
intentional act and ``the most likely person with the access,
knowledge and possible motivation to accomplish this act has been
identified as Gunner's Mate 2nd Class Clayton Hartwig.''
   The Navy said the 24-year-old Hartwig, of Cleveland, was
suicidal and that he placed a detonating device between sacks of
gun propellant in the middle gun of the three-gun turret and
triggered the device.
   ``I think that conclusion must be in the `Guiness Book of World
Records' for the longest standing leap from conjecture to an
unsupportable conclusion,'' said retired Rear Adm. Eugene Carroll,
executive director of the Center of Defense Information in
Washington, D.C., and a frequent Navy critic.
   Kreig Brusnahan, a Cleveland attorney representing Hartwig's
family, said congressional hearings will show incompetency and bias
in the Navy's report.
   ``The Navy is still engaged in a coverup. ... Every action taken
is designed to find human error instead of the truth,'' said Ellis
Rubin, a Miami attorney representing Kendall Truitt, one of the
survivors of the explosion.
   Lt. Cmdr. Craig Quigley, a Navy spokesman at the Pentagon, said
the service stands behind the report as unbiased, factual and
correct.
   Both Carroll and Brusnahan point out that the Navy also
documented numerous administrative and training irregularities
aboard the battleship. The Navy concluded that none of those
deficiencies contributed to the explosion.
   Carroll said the Navy made that judgment for a self-serving
reason.
   ``My reasoning is that the big issue is, `Should we have an
Iowa?' Should we spend the money and men to operate a 45-year-old
ship with obsolete equipment, equipment that has failed in the
past? They diverted attention away from the question of the Iowa,''
he said.
   Critics also pointed to tests done by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation that found no trace of a detonating device. The Navy
said its experts and equipment were superior to the FBI's.
   Sailors' families were upset by leaks from the Navy during a
Naval Investigative Service probe into Hartwig's background. The
leaked reports claimed that a lapsed relationship between Hartwig
and another gunner's mate, Kendall Truitt, motivated Hartwig in his
suicidal tendencies. The final Navy report said there was no
substance to the allegations about the relationship.
   ``The way I see the investigation, the Navy took 20 days to
determine it was not an accident, then spent the rest of their time
to build their case against Clay,'' said Nancy Lewis, whose
23-year-old son Richard died in the explosion. ``I don't believe
Clayton did this.''

   With his wife showing signs of progress after
the world's first heart, liver and kidney transplant, John Martin
was on the telephone in a delicate conversation. On the line was
the husband of the donor.
   The talk was brief, said Dimitri Mavris, whose wife, 26-year-old
Auli, died from injuries suffered in a freak automobile accident.
Auli Mavris' organs were transplanted into 26-year-old Cindy Martin
in Pittsburgh on Monday.
   ``He said, `You have given us a great gift,' and I said, `She
would have wanted it that way. Our prayers are with you and your
wife,''' Mavris said.
   Mrs. Mavris was killed after being struck by a car driven by a
neighbor in a parking lot by her apartment in Atlanta, when she was
taking a load of trash to a bin.
   Mrs. Martin remained in critical condition, considered normal
after transplant surgery, in Presbyterian-University Hospital's
intensive care unit. Doctors said Monday they were encouraged by
her progress and planned to wean her from a respirator. They said
infection had become her greatest risk.
   ``Hopefully, she will go home in three or four weeks,'' said Dr.
John Armitage, who performed the heart transplant. ``Right now her
organ function looks encouraging. She's awake and writing us
notes.''
   Although multi-organ transplants have been done before, this was
the first involving the heart, liver and a kidney, Armitage said.
   Three other people have received combination heart-liver
transplants, but only Stormie Jones, a 12-year-old Texas girl who
received her new organs in February 1984, has survived the
procedure.
   The 21{-hour operation, which ended at 5 p.m. Sunday, was broken
into three parts, with the heart transplanted first, the liver
second and the kidney last.
   ``Her greatest need was for improved circulation and treatment
of her failed heart. That was addressed first,'' Armitage said.
``Her kidneys, although bad, were the least of her multi-organ
system failure.''
   In Chicago, the recipient of the nation's first living-donor
liver transplant, 22-month-old Alyssa Smith, was in serious but
stable condition, University of Chicago Hospitals spokeswoman Mary
Fetsch said today. Doctors are pleased with her progress eight days
after the procedure, the spokeswoman said. She has been moved out
of intensive care to a private room and shows no signs of rejecting
the liver.
   Her mother, Teresa, who donated a piece of her liver for the
operation, was in good condition and expected to be released from
the hospital this week, Ms. Fetsch said.
   Mrs. Martin suffers from familial cardiomyopathy, an inherited
heart disease. Her father died when he was 31 and many relatives on
his side of the family have died young, Martin said.
   On Oct. 20, 1985, one day after the couple were married, Mrs.
Martin was admitted to Presbyterian-University Hospital to await
her first heart transplant. She received it Nov. 6.
   Since then, she has suffered from chronic rejection of the heart
and developed hepatits and kidney dysfunction.
   Martin, 28, said at a news conference that he's been telling his
wife ``to hang in there and hope that our lives are finally going
to turn around.''
   Mrs. Martin had to give up her secretarial job and has spent
most of her time at home in Archbald doing only light household
chores, because she tired easily and developed several infections,
said her husband, a manufacturing engineer.
   Armitage said ethical questions of retransplantation, despite
the shortage of donor organs, ``was not a major consideration'' in
Mrs. Martin's case.
   ``She is a very young patient,'' he said. ``We were very
committed to her.''

<HEAD>Army Wants to Double Hit Probability</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FORT BENNING, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army is searching for an automatic
rifle to replace the M-16, which soldiers have used since the
Vietnam war.
   The goal is to develop a weapon that will make the 21st century
soldier twice as effective at wounding or killing enemy troops,
overcoming battlefield stress and unpredictable targets.
   ``The M16A2 is the finest combat rifle in the world, but the
accuracy of that weapon because of human factors is not as high as
one would like it to be,'' said Pete Rowland, public affairs
officer for the Army's Armament Research, Development and
Engineering Center at Picatinny Arsenal, N.J.
   Since September, 36 Army and Air Force shooters have been
conducting preliminary tests with four advanced combat rifle
prototypes at Fort Benning.
   The Army has spent about $40 million since 1982 on research and
development and expects to spend another $17 million by 1991, when
officials decide what technology to pursue.
   The prototypes were submitted by Colt Industries of Hartford,
Conn.; Steyr-Daimler-Puch of Steyr, Austria; AAI Corp. of Hunt
Valley, Md.; and Heckler &amp; Koch, a German firm with a U.S.
subsidiary in Chantilly, Va.
   The Colt rifle fires conventional ammunition or a duplex
cartridge with two projectiles. Colt claims one projectile travels
to the point of aim and the other diverges slightly to increase hit
probability.
   The Steyr uses a plastic-cased cartridge that fires a steel
flechette, or dart. The AAI rifle fires a brass cartridge with a
flechette and the Heckler &amp; Koch a bullet from a ``caseless
cartridge'' made of molded propellant.
   Rowland said the Army is trying to develop a rifle that fires
lightweight, low-cost ammunition.
   ``The soldier of today ... is weightily equipped,'' he said.
``Anything that can be done to make that lighter _ and a lot is
being done _ will increase his effectiveness. Probably from head to
foot, the Army is looking for a way to lighten the load.''
   The M-16 already is lighter than the Soviet-designed AK-47, but
that assault rifle has the reputation of being more durable on the
dirty battlefield than the M-16. The M-16 typically takes smaller
ammunition than the AK and most other assault rifles.
   In battle, the soldier's shooting skills are hampered by a
variety of factors, such as stress, fatigue, weather conditions and
obscured targets, Rowland noted.
   ``The goal is to develop some compensations in the weapon to
offset the outside factors that affect a soldier in battle,'' he
added. ``The soldier ... has to have twice the accuracy that he has
with the current version.''
   Earlier this year, the Army conducted extensive engineering and
safety tests on the prototypes at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md.
   The Army has scheduled a media briefing and demonstration of the
weapons Dec. 13 at Fort Benning. In January, another team of Army
and Air Force shooters will arrive at Benning to begin another
three months of testing.
   Bill Harris, a media relations specialist at Picatinny Arsenal,
said there is no timetable for phasing out the M-16.
   ``Since the M-16 is over 20 years old now, the Defense
Department has decided to look at new technology,'' he said. ``The
average life of a military rifle is 20 to 30 years, going back to
the flintlocks used in the Revolutionary War. If we find a
technology that meets the needs of doubling the effectiveness of
the M-16, then ... we could have a new weapon in the hands of
troops as early as 1995.''
   The M-16 was first issued to U.S. troops in 1967. During the
Vietnam war it was criticized for jamming. The problem was
corrected by using a different type of gunpower in the rifle's
5.56-mm ammunition. The latest version, known as the M-16A2, was
introduced in 1987. It has a maximum effective range of 550 meters
and is more accurate and reliable than the earlier versions, Harris
said.
   ``The M-16 is a very reliable weapon,'' he added. ``It's
considered one of the best combat rifles in the world.''

<HEAD>Amish Newspaper Celebrates 100th Anniversary</HEAD>

   The only newspaper of the Amish and
Mennonites is owned by a Jewish family, edited by a Lutheran and
has its readers double as unpaid reporters.
   Butter churning, recipes and buggy accidents are among the
subjects that fill the pages of The Budget, which is gearing up for
its 100th anniversary as what may be the most widely circulated
small-town newspaper in the country.
   George Smith, 82, has worked at the newspaper in this Tuscarawas
County village of 2,000 in eastern Ohio since his father bought the
paper in 1920. There are no Amish and two Mennonites on the staff.
   ``One problem with Amish girls is they work a couple of years
then get married,'' said Smith. As for the Amish men: ``It's not
their kind of work.''
   Smith supervises the 600 or so ``scribes'' who send in
handwritten items of parochial interest from Amish and Mennonite
settlements in such places as Charm, Ohio; Macon, Miss.; Sarasota,
Fla.; and Intercourse, Pa. Smith, whose title is associate editor _
although there is no editor _ also lays out the pages.
   Smith, who became editor and publisher in 1936, sold the paper
to two employees in 1974. When they left, Albert Spector of Wooster
bought the paper in 1981.
   Spector, who is Jewish, owns Spector's stores, a major
advertiser in The Budget and supplier of dry goods to the Amish and
Mennonites.
   Every week the paper receives as many as 400 letters from the
scattered communities describing births, marriages, buggy accidents
and the weather.
   There are two editions, one serving Sugarcreek and surrounding
areas and the national edition, which carries more than 300 letters
from Plain People settlements in the lower 48 states and more than
a dozen foreign countries.
   A special 100th anniversary edition will be sent to The Budget's
18,000 subscribers in May. Smith is planning a summer party for all
his correspondents.
   Smith said he edits the letters for spelling, punctuation and
clarity, but ``we like to keep the flavor.''
   For instance, an Amish from Stockport, Ohio, had this
butter-churning tale: ``Floyd Beechy rigged a plastic crate on the
center of the buggy wheel. In this he fastened a plastic jug of
cream. As he or the Mrs. had to drive the scholars to school every
day, this saved churning at home. Now they have 2 girls at home and
probably don't churn anymore.''
   From Guys Mills, Pa.: ``James A. Miller is laid up with a torn
ligament in back of his leg and internal bleeding. This happened
while chasing heifers.''
   And from Jamesport, Mo.: ``It seems the postal service is
getting slack again. For quite awhile we received The Budget on
Sat., but lately it doesn't come till Mon.''
   Reports of violent crime are rare because occurrences are rare,
Smith said.
   ``We try to avoid anything about crime. We don't feel it has a
place in The Budget ... unless it really directly involves the
Amish.''
   The paper has grown from four pages to 30 or more since its
first edition and production has been modernized. The Budget is now
on its third computer system, complete with laser printer, and some
Mennonite letters arrive by fax.
   The Budget scribes are not paid. But good writers receive
stamped envelopes to mail in stories. If they're really good, they
get free subscriptions.
   There are no photographs in the national edition, as the Amish
shun having their pictures taken. Recipes as well as display and
classified ads are included.
   Surgarcreek is surrounded by the largest settlement of Amish in
the world, with 20,000 to 25,000 living in Holmes, Wayne, Coshoctan
and Tuscarawas counties in Ohio. About 100,000 Amish people live in
the United States. Figures on the Mennonite population were
unavailable.

<HEAD>Government To Ban Tobacco Ads In Print Media</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Dollar amounts U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Government today said it
plans to outlaw cigarette advertising in the print media in an
attempt to slash the $2 billion a year spent on health care for
smokers.
   ``It reflects the concern that tobacco consumption is the major
preventable cause of illness in the Australian community today,''
Health Minister Neal Blewett said in announcing the decision.
   ``The Government has a clear responsibility to act to discourage
Australians from smoking and particularly to reduce pressures on
young people to take up smoking.''
   Advertising of tobacco products has been banned in the
electronic media since 1976.
   Blewett said the government would amend the Smoking and Tobacco
Products Advertisements Bill to legislate the ban on advertising in
newspapers and magazines.
   He said there was sufficient evidence of a link between tobacco
advertising and the taking up of smoking to justify the
government's decision on strong public health grounds.
   ``Although advertising is not the only determinant in people's
decision to smoke, research has established that it does affect and
reinforce other influences such as peer and social pressures,''
Blewett said.
   The ban will bring Australia into line with many other countries
that have outlawed tobacco advertising, including Canada, Norway,
Finland, Italy, Portugal, Singapore and Iceland.
   Blewett noted that research in Norway had shown ``substantial
falls'' in smoking among adolescents since a ban took effect in
that country in 1975.
   Sports Minister Graham Richardson said earlier he opposed a
total ban on tobacco advertising because some sports relied heavily
on tobacco sponsorship.
   He said that sport received about $16 million a year from
tobacco companies in Australia and that replacement sponsorships of
that size would be difficult.

   The District of Columbia police department has
concluded its officers acted properly in handling allegations that
Mayor Marion Barry was hospitalized for a drug overdose six years

   Police Chief Isaac Fulwood believes the department and
then-chief Maurice Turner were right to drop the matter after the
allegation could not be corroborated, sources told The Washington

   A Howard University psychiatrist reportedly told police
